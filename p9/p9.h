how does p9/p9.h need to be modified to implement p9wl-rdp-alpine
```
/*
 * p9.h - 9P2000 Protocol Implementation
 *
 * Provides a client implementation of the 9P2000 protocol for connecting
 * to Plan 9 file servers. Supports both plaintext and TLS connections.
 *
 * 9P2000 Overview:
 *
 *   9P is a simple, message-based protocol for accessing remote files.
 *   Each operation is a request/response pair (T-message/R-message).
 *   Files are identified by "fids" - client-chosen 32-bit handles.
 *
 *   Connection lifecycle:
 *     1. TCP connect (optionally wrap with TLS)
 *     2. Tversion/Rversion - negotiate protocol version and message size
 *     3. Tattach/Rattach - authenticate and get root fid
 *     4. Twalk/Rwalk - navigate to files
 *     5. Topen/Ropen - open files for I/O
 *     6. Tread/Twrite - read/write data
 *     7. Tclunk/Rclunk - release fids
 *
 * Wire Format:
 *
 *   All messages start with: size[4] type[1] tag[2]
 *   Multi-byte integers are little-endian.
 *   Strings are length-prefixed: len[2] data[len]
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 *
 *   Each p9conn has a mutex that protects RPC operations. The synchronous
 *   functions (p9_read, p9_write, etc.) acquire this lock automatically.
 *   For pipelined writes, the caller must manage concurrency.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 *
 *   Connection errors (socket failures, TLS errors) are fatal - the
 *   p9_read_full() and p9_write_full() functions call exit(1) on error.
 *   This is appropriate for p9wl where connection loss is unrecoverable.
 *
 *   Protocol errors (Rerror responses) set flags in p9conn and return -1:
 *     - unknown_id_error: draw image ID not found
 *     - draw_error: error containing "short" (e.g., short write)
 *     - window_deleted: rio window was closed
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   struct p9conn p9;
 *   struct tls_config tls = { .cert_file = "server.pem" };
 *
 *   if (p9_connect(&p9, "192.168.1.1", P9_TLS_PORT, &tls) < 0) {
 *       // handle error
 *   }
 *
 *   // Read a file
 *   char buf[1024];
 *   int n = p9_read_file(&p9, "snarf", buf, sizeof(buf));
 *
 *   // Low-level operations
 *   uint32_t fid = p9.next_fid++;
 *   const char *path[] = { "draw", "new" };
 *   p9_walk(&p9, p9.root_fid, fid, 2, path);
 *   p9_open(&p9, fid, ORDWR, NULL);
 *   p9_read(&p9, fid, 0, sizeof(buf), (uint8_t*)buf);
 *   p9_clunk(&p9, fid);
 *
 *   p9_disconnect(&p9);
