/*
 * wl_input.h - Wayland input event processing
 *
 * This module bridges Plan 9 input events to Wayland clients. Input is
 * read from Plan 9 devices (/dev/mouse, /dev/kbd) by background threads,
 * queued via the input_queue, and processed here on the main Wayland
 * event loop thread.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *
 *   Plan 9 Input Threads          Main Thread
 *   ----------------------        -----------
 *   mouse_thread reads            handle_input_events()
 *   /dev/mouse, pushes to  --->   pops events from queue,
 *   input_queue                   calls handle_mouse()
 *
 *   kbd_thread reads               handle_key() processes
 *   /dev/kbd, pushes to    --->   keyboard events
 *   input_queue
 *
 * Mouse Handling:
 *
 *   handle_mouse() translates Plan 9 mouse events (absolute position,
 *   button bitmask) to Wayland pointer events:
 *
 *     - Cursor position updates via wlr_cursor_warp_absolute()
 *       (coordinates clamped to visible window area, not padded buffer)
 *     - Pointer focus changes via focus_handle_click()
 *     - Button press/release via wlr_seat_pointer_notify_button()
 *     - Scroll wheel via wlr_seat_pointer_notify_axis()
 *
 *   The button mapping uses a table-driven approach:
 *     Bit 0 (1)  -> BTN_LEFT
 *     Bit 1 (2)  -> BTN_MIDDLE
 *     Bit 2 (4)  -> BTN_RIGHT
 *     Bits 3-6   -> Scroll directions
 *
 *   Scroll source:
 *     Plan 9's /dev/mouse delivers scroll as discrete button bits
 *     regardless of the physical device. All scroll events are
 *     reported as SOURCE_WHEEL with value120 discrete steps.
 *
 * Keyboard Handling:
 *
 *   handle_key() translates Plan 9 runes (Unicode codepoints or special
 *   key codes) to Wayland key events:
 *
 *     - Escape key can dismiss grabbed popups
 *     - Modifier keys update the focus manager's modifier state
 *     - Regular keys are looked up in the keymap
 *     - Key events sent via wlr_seat_keyboard_notify_key()
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   Register handle_input_events as a pipe event source:
 *
 *     server->input_event = wl_event_loop_add_fd(loop,
 *         server->input_queue.pipe_fd[0],
 *         WL_EVENT_READABLE,
 *         handle_input_events,
 *         server);
