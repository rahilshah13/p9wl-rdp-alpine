/*
 * output.h - Output and input device management
 *
 * This module handles Wayland output (display) creation and the frame
 * rendering loop, as well as input device attachment.
 *
 * Output Handling:
 *
 *   new_output() is called when wlroots creates a new output. For p9wl,
 *   there is typically one headless output sized to match the Plan 9
 *   window's visible dimensions (s->visible_width × s->visible_height).
 *   The output is configured with:
 *
 *     - Custom mode matching the Plan 9 window's visible dimensions
 *     - 60Hz refresh rate (60000 mHz)
 *     - Optional HiDPI scale factor (if s->scale > 1.0)
 *     - Scene graph output for rendering
 *
 * Frame Loop:
 *
 *   The output_frame handler (internal) runs the compositor's render loop:
 *
 *     1. Check for pending resize from mouse thread (s->resize_pending)
 *     2. If resize pending:
 *        a. Reallocate host buffers at padded dimensions (TILE_ALIGN_UP)
 *        b. Reallocate dirty tile bitmaps (tiles_x × tiles_y, exact)
 *        c. Update s->width, s->height (padded), s->visible_width/height
 *        d. Update s->tiles_x, s->tiles_y (exact: width/TILE_SIZE)
 *        e. Reallocate Plan 9 images via reallocate_draw_images()
 *        f. Resize wlroots output to visible dimensions
 *        g. Reconfigure all toplevels with logical visible dimensions
 *        h. Set force_full_frame and scene_dirty flags
 *     3. Throttle frames if FRAME_INTERVAL_MS is non-zero
 *     4. Check scene_dirty and force_full_frame flags.  If both are
 *        clear, send frame_done and return immediately — skipping
 *        build_state, buffer copy, and send_frame.  This is the
 *        primary idle-screen optimization.  scene_dirty is set by
 *        client commits; force_full_frame is set by resize handling
 *        (step 2) and error recovery.
 *     5. Build scene output state via wlr_scene_output_build_state()
 *     6. Extract compositor damage into dirty tile staging bitmap
 *     7. Copy rendered pixels from wlroots buffer to s->framebuf.
 *        The wlroots buffer is visible_width × visible_height; framebuf
 *        has stride = s->width (padded to TILE_SIZE).  Only visible rows
 *        and columns are copied; padding strips are zeroed by the send
 *        thread.  Full visible-area copy is required because pointer
 *        swap between framebuf and send_buf recycles buffers with stale
 *        data.  The scene_dirty gate in step 4 ensures this only runs
 *        when content actually changed.
 *     8. Commit output state and send frame done
 *     9. Trigger send_frame() when there is actual work
 *
 * Damage-Based Dirty Tile Tracking:
 *
 *   The headless backend reports full-screen damage on every frame,
 *   making ostate.damage useless for idle detection.  Instead, idle
 *   frames are skipped via the scene_dirty flag (step 4 above).
 *
 *   When rendering does occur, ostate.damage is still extracted into
 *   a per-tile bitmap (s->dirty_staging) and used to tell the send
 *   thread which tiles to compress and transmit.  The tile grid uses
 *   padded dimensions (tiles_x = width/TILE_SIZE, always exact).
 *   Tiles in the padding region are never marked dirty by the
 *   compositor since no visible content touches them.  The framebuf
 *   copy writes only the visible area; padding strips are zeroed
 *   by the send thread.
 *
 *   The send thread trusts the damage bitmap as ground truth: undamaged
 *   tiles are skipped without pixel comparison, damaged tiles are
 *   assumed changed.
 *
 *   Fallback: if damage extraction fails (allocation error),
 *   dirty_staging_valid remains 0 and the send thread falls back to
 *   pixel comparison via tile_changed().
 *
 * Image Reallocation:
 *
 *   reallocate_draw_images() (internal) handles Plan 9 image resize:
 *     - Frees old framebuffer and delta images via 'f' command
 *     - Allocates new images at new dimensions via 'b' command
 *     - Uses alloc_image_cmd/free_image_cmd helpers from draw_cmd.h
 *
 * Input Device Handling:
 *
 *   new_input() attaches pointer devices to the cursor. Keyboard input
 *   comes from Plan 9 via the input threads, not from Wayland input
 *   devices, so keyboard devices are ignored.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   Wire up handlers during server initialization:
 *
 *     server->new_output.notify = new_output;
 *     wl_signal_add(&backend->events.new_output, &server->new_output);
 *
 *     server->new_input.notify = new_input;
 *     wl_signal_add(&backend->events.new_input, &server->new_input);
