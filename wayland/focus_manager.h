/*
 * focus_manager.h - Unified focus state machine
 *
 * This module consolidates all focus-related logic for the p9wl compositor:
 *
 *   - Pointer focus: which surface receives mouse events
 *   - Keyboard focus: which surface receives key events  
 *   - Popup management: grab stack for menus and dropdowns
 *   - Surface lifecycle: focus transitions on map/unmap/destroy
 *
 * Design:
 *
 *   The focus manager maintains two independent focus targets. Pointer focus
 *   follows the cursor and determines where motion/button events are sent.
 *   Keyboard focus is typically set by clicks or popup grabs and determines
 *   where key events are sent.
 *
 *   Popup grabs form a stack. When a grabbed popup is active, it receives
 *   keyboard focus. Dismissing popups restores focus to the parent popup
 *   or the underlying toplevel.
 *
 *   Focus changes are deferred while mouse buttons are held to prevent
 *   focus from changing mid-drag.
 *
 * Include Order:
 *
 *   This header is included by types.h to define struct focus_manager and
 *   struct popup_data. Do NOT include types.h here to avoid circular
 *   dependency. Use forward declarations for struct server, struct toplevel.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   Initialize during server startup:
 *
 *     focus_manager_init(&server->focus, server);
 *
 *   Handle clicks with focus logic:
 *
 *     struct wlr_surface *target = focus_handle_click(&server->focus,
 *         clicked_surface, sx, sy, button);
 *
 *   Focus a toplevel window:
 *
 *     focus_toplevel(&server->focus, toplevel, FOCUS_REASON_POINTER_CLICK);
 *
 *   Clean up during shutdown:
 *
 *     focus_manager_cleanup(&server->focus);
